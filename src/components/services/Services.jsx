      'Acupuncture is based on the idea that energy (or "qi") flows through meridian pathways in the body. Each meridian is uniquely connected to a certain organ within the body. When this flow is blocked or imbalanced, it can lead to pain and chronic health issues. By inserting needles at specific points, acupuncturists aim to unblock or balance this energy making it a holistic approach to health and wellness. Acupuncture techniques are not limited to needling, a licensed acupuncturist can develop a customized treatment plan which may include: fire cupping, gua sha, electro-stimulation (with needling), tui na, and moxibustion.Â ',
